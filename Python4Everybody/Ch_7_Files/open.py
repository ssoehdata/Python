# open() function
# makes it possible to read the file
# it returns a file handle (a variable) used to perform operations on the file

# handle = open(filename, mode) - takes atleast one parameter(name of file)
# additional parameters are optional (e.g. mode / 'r' for read, 'w' for write etc)

# handle is a thing that allows you to get to the file
#example: 
# fhand = open('mbox.txt')
# print(fhand)
